# Contributing

This is Open Source Software. We realized that we didn't pass the Patch Test

## What to contribute

Here's a few places to start:

- Report any bugs you find.
- No, seriously! Most of the bugs don't even get reported, or the reporter only writes "Doesn't work for me" and then vanishes.
- ["help wanted" issues](https://github.com/majn/telegram-purple/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+-label%3A%22in-pipeline%22), especially automated testing
- ["secret chat" issues](https://github.com/majn/telegram-purple/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22secret+chats%22+-label%3A%22in-pipeline%22+)
- Portability (especially endianness) of tgl (external project)
- [Issues of tgl](https://github.com/vysheng/tgl/issues) -- lots and lots of false or obsolete reports
- Slim down the size of the generated files in `tgl/auto`, as this currently dominates the build time. Yuk!
- Make sure that the libpurple-devs don't break libpurple any further.

## How to contribute

Write [an issue](https://github.com/majn/telegram-purple/issues/new), shoot us a mail (scrape the address from the git history), or contact us in dev chat (changing URL, see README for that).
